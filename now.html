    <div class="update">
      <p>At the end of September, <span class="label--highlight">I decided to leave Colony</span>, the company I co-founded, after 4.5 years. I probably have an entire
      post explaining why and how I came to that conclusion, but suffice it to say it was the right time for me to move forward.</p>
      <p><span class="label--highlight">My main focus now is coding</span>. For about 2-years, I’ve been learning to code part time. I’ve completed a <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/front-end-web-developer-nanodegree--nd0011" target="_blank" class="underline">Udacity
      nanodegree <span class="arrow">→</span></a>, built a chrome extension, and have done some other online courses and small side projects. Yet I have never felt like I had the depth that I wanted. Faced with an idea and a blank editor I struggled to really make much progress.</p>
      <p>That’s when I heard about <a href="https://launchschool.com/" target="_blank" class="underline">Launch School <span class="arrow">→</span></a>. Their mastery-based pedagogy really spoke to me and, at the end of 2019, I
      decided to enroll. I’ve been working through that part-time, but now that I’m no longer at Colony, this is the main thing I’m focusing on. I’m still early on in their curriculum, but my comprehension is really strong and I’m feeling
      much more capable.</p>
      <p><span class="label--highlight">I’m also in the job market for the first time in my adult life</span>. My ideal role is as a director of product at a series B
      startup. My experience interviewing so far has been mixed. As someone who has only ever been a founder, I’m a fairly atypical candidate.</p>
      <p>I have a breadth of hands-on experience across ops and product, and depth as an owner / leader who’s spent 10+ years
      growing people, teams, and companies. I’m a strong product-first generalist who’s comfortable asking questions, finding
      the right problems, and figuring things out in ambiguous environments. Yet I’m not as niched or vertically deep as many
      candidates applying to specific roles. I’ve seen this be both a pro and a con.</p>
      <p><span class="label--highlight">One company that's valued my unique experience is Google</span>. I passed through their hiring process and was approved by their hiring committee earlier this year. I’m currently in the
      team match / offer stage with them.</p>
      <p>I don’t know where I’ll end up next, or when it’ll happen, but I do feel excited to enter this next stage of my career.</p>
